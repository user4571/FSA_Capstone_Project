#FSA_Capstone_Project
Fullstack Academy Capstone Achievement

Capstone project for Fullstack Academy Cybersecurity course.
•	Designed a test spear-phishing attack aimed a specific individual. 
•	Conducted OSIT operations to determine the best attack vector to convince the target to click on a malicious link
•	Created a malicious web page to mimic a legitimate web site with malicious download embedded in a link
•	Wrote malware to encrypt the victim’s file system when executed

NOTE: This project is for demo purposes only and never implemented, nor was it ever intended to be implimented, in the wild.

The main file in this repository is the video presentation my team gave explaining what we did and how we did it.
The other files consist of the following:
1) The fake html file I crafted to imitate https://www.lostlandsfestival.com/  (Some functionality will be impacted when the host site changes.)
2) A placeholder text file that replaces the actual malware we used. 

Reminder: This repository is for informational/demonstartion purposes only. Do not attempt to perform or imitate.
