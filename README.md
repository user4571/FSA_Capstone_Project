###FSA_Capstone_Project
Fullstack Academy Capstone Achievement

This is a capstone project for Fullstack Academy Cybersecurity course. The project consisted of the following:
•	Design a test spear-phishing attack aimed a specific individual.
•	Conduct OSIT operations to determine the best attack vector to convince the target to click on a malicious link
•	Create a malicious web page to mimic a legitimate web site with malicious download embedded in a link
•	Write malware to encrypt the victim’s file system when executed

NOTE: This project is for demo purposes only and is not meant to be used outside this demonstration.

The contents of the repository are as follows:
~ FinalProjectVideo.7z is video presentation we gave. The file is an mp4 compressed using 7 zip. 
~ Operation Ahab.pdf is the pdf we used in giving the presentation.
~ README is this file.
~ Index.html is the html script I used as a spoof site. Original code 'borrowed' from: https://www.lostlandsfestival.com/ (I expect aspects of the spoof site will break when the original is modified or is taken down.)
~ sample.txt is a token file that replaced the malicious file we used in the demo.

Reminder: This repository is for informational/demonstration purposes only. Do not attempt to perform or imitate.

Project creators are: Talen Flippo, George Kell, Tristan Khim, Brandon OLeary, and Rodney Ramirez.
