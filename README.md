# Final_Project
Fullstack Academy Final Project

Capstone project for Fullstack Academy Cybersecurity course.
In summery, we devised a mock spear phishing campaign.
NOTE: This project is for demo purposes only and never implemented, nor was it ever intended to be implimented, in the wild.

The main file in this repository is the video presentation my team gave explaining what we did and how we did it.
The other files consist of the following:
1) The fake html file I crafted to imitate https://www.lostlandsfestival.com/  (Some functionality will be impactedwhen the host site changes.)
2) A placeholder text file that replaces the actual malware we used. 

Reminder: This repository is for informational/demonstartion purposes only. Do not attempt to perform or imitate.
